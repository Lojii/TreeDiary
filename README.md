# Git&Markdown
The security and privacy of your data is the most important thing for TreeDiary.
So I introduced Git, which is a distributed version control system used by almost every programmer.  A piece of data, can be specified to store in multiple places, and maintain real-time synchronization of data; With Markdown format, data can still be read and written even without the App, without manual export and backup. 
Git carries the gene of multi-person collaboration, and it is also very convenient and easy for multiple people to write a diary together, suitable for family diary, couple diary, baby diary, etc.
You can back up your data in one or more places, synchronize it to your computer, Github, Gitlab, or other service providers at any time, or set up Git services for data synchronization using open source systems.
